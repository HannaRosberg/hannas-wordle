I have made so the whole repository is started by typing npm start in the main directrory, so you dont need to navigate to either frontend or backend.

Clone the repository
Navigate to the main directory
Run: npm run install-all
Run: npm start
Server is starting on port 5080

At the moment, the server only connects to a local MongoDB database: `mongodb://localhost:27017/wordle`
